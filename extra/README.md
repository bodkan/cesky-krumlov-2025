This directory contains bonus material on

-   playing around with PCA shapes in traditional demographic models

-   investigating PCA patterns in geospatial demographic models

-   admixture tracts and chromosome painting

all using _slendr_ features.

This is not something we'll be working on in this particular course (it's part
of a larger course on simulation-based applied popgen that I'm working on that
will be based on this workshop) but feel free to poke around if you're bored!
