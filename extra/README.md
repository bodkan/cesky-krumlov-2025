This directory contains bonus material on

-   investigating PCA patterns in geospatial demographic models, and

-   admixture tracts and chromosome painting,

both using *slendr* features. This is not something we'll be working on in this particular course (it's part of a larger course on simulation-based applied popgen that I'm working on that will be based on this workshop) but feel free to poke around if you're bored!
