# Building intuition into popgen fundamentals and inference

## Workshop on population and speciation genomics

### Český Krumlov, January 2025

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Slides, exercise materials, and example source code for the practical activity
session at the [**Workshop on population and speciation genomics**](http://evomics.org/workshops/workshop-on-population-and-speciation-genomics/2025-workshop-on-population-and-speciation-genomics-cesky-krumlov/) to be held in Český Krumlov in January 2025.

**Contents of this git repository**:

- [slides](https://bodkan.quarto.pub/cesky-krumlov-2025-slides/) and
[single-page handouts](https://bodkan.quarto.pub/cesky-krumlov-2025-handouts/)
-- these contain a crash course introduction on using the _slendr_ toolkit for
simulations in population genomics that you can use for reference while working
on the exercises (I will be going through these slides at the beginning of our
activity session)

- [exercise materials](https://bodkan.quarto.pub/cesky-krumlov-2025-exercises/)
-- this is the main focus of our activity session (solutions are built-in but
hidden by default)

The slides, handouts and exercises are also available for download as
self-contained HTML files, just in case Quarto Pub server is down:
[slides.html](slides.html), [handouts.html](handouts.html),
[exercises.html](exercises.html).

## Installation setup, and other instructions

Refer to the [exercises materials](https://bodkan.quarto.pub/cesky-krumlov-2025-exercises/)
for all necessary information
on installation and setup.

## Information for TAs

The goal of every exercise in the activity is to write a self-contained script
in R using the _slendr_ R package (one script for each exercise).

It's quite likely you haven't worked with _slendr_ before and that's quite
alright, there's no reason to panic. :) Although some of the exercises can get
quite complex, even students who have only begun learning population genetics
(and aren't even comfortable with R) will be able to follow the activities
easily because the exact solutions are built in the exercise materials.
In ideal circumstances, students might only need a bit of help with R coding,
and you (and I, obviously) will be able to do that by taking a peek at each
respective solution R script, as needed. **You don't really have to know
_slendr_ to be able to help the students! Just use the provided solutions
to guide them.**

Note that there's quite a lot of content in the exercises, and a lot of it is
marked as "bonus". This bonus content is designed for expert R programmers and
people who would be otherwise bored. If someone does run into an issue with
that and has a question, I will be able to deal with that easily. Don't worry
about those at all. In fact, unless things go extremely smoothly, we might not
even make it to the very final part of the last exercise. It all depends on how
comfortable the participants will be with R programming.

All the information that the students might need to do the exercises is
available in the [slides](https://bodkan.quarto.pub/cesky-krumlov-2025-slides/)
and [handouts](https://bodkan.quarto.pub/cesky-krumlov-2025-handounts/)
(which are rendered from the slides for easier reference). The activity
session will begin by me walking through the slides first to get everyone
on the same page before proceeding with the exercises. You don't have to walk
through these slides yourself, unless you really want to.
