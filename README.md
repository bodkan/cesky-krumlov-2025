# **Building intuition into population genetic concepts and simulation-based inference**

## Workshop on population and speciation genomics

### Český Krumlov, January 2025

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Slides, exercise materials, and example source code for the practical activity session at the [**Workshop on population and speciation genomics**](http://evomics.org/workshops/workshop-on-population-and-speciation-genomics/2025-workshop-on-population-and-speciation-genomics-cesky-krumlov/) to be held in Český Krumlov in January 2025.

**Contents of this git repository**:

-   [slides](https://bodkan.quarto.pub/cesky-krumlov-2025-slides/) and [single-page handouts](https://bodkan.quarto.pub/cesky-krumlov-2025-handouts/) with a crash course introduction on using the *slendr* toolkit for simulations in population genomics that you can use for reference while working on the exercises

-   [exercise materials](https://bodkan.quarto.pub/cesky-krumlov-2025-exercises/)

-   [solutions](https://github.com/bodkan/cesky-krumlov-2025/tree/main/solutions) to the exercises (one self-contained R script for each exercise)

The slides, handouts and exercises are also available for download as self-contained HTML files, just in case Quarto Pub server is down: [slides.html](slides.html), [handouts.html](handouts.html), [exercises.html](exercises.html).

## Installation, setup, and other instructions

Refer to the [exercises materials](exercises.md) for all necessary information.

## Information for TAs

The goal of every exercise in the activity is to write a self-contained script in R using the *slendr* R package (one script for each of the five exercises). I recommend that everyone works in RStudio, but this is mostly for convenience. As long as the students can make figures in R, they can you whatever method of programming that they are accustomed to.

It's quite likely you haven't worked with *slendr* before and that's quite alright, there's no reason to panic. :) Although some of the exercises can get quite complex, even students who have only begun learning population genetics (and aren't even comfortable with R) will be able to follow the activities easily because the exact solutions to every exercise are available [here](https://github.com/bodkan/cesky-krumlov-2025/tree/main/solutions). In ideal circumstances, students might only need a bit of help with R coding, and you (and I, obviously) will be able to do that by taking a peek at each respective solution R script, as needed.

As for installation and setup, there are detailed instructions in the exercises materials [here](https://github.com/bodkan/cesky-krumlov-2025/blob/main/exercises.md).

Note that there's quite a lot of content in the exercises, and a lot of it is marked as "bonus". This bonus content is designed for expert R programmers and people who would be otherwise bored. If someone does run into an issue with that and has a question, I will be able to deal with that easily.

All the information that the students might need to do the exercises is available in the [slides](https://bodkan.quarto.pub/cesky-krumlov-2025/) and [handouts](https://bodkan.quarto.pub/cesky-krumlov-2025-onepage/) (which are rendered from the slides for easier reference). The activity session will begin by me walking through the slides first to get everyone on the same page before proceeding with the exercises.
